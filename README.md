# landing-page
This project is an HTML/CSS exclusive. Here I'm practicing using HTML and CSS features to make a landing page for a random topic of my choice. The goal of this project is to practice using;

1. Best practices in HTML, CSS and Git
2. The Box Model of CSS
3. Flexbox tools

This webpage uses images from One Piece official sources,  including Shueishia, Toei Animation, Eichiro Oda, and Shonen Jump.

Some images are fan-sourced, but I was unable to find proper citations.
