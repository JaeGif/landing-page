# landing-page
This project is an HTML/CSS exclusive. Here I'm practicing using HTML and CSS features to make a landing page for a random topic of my choice. The goal of this project is to practice using;

1. Best practices in HTML, CSS and Git
2. The Box Model of CSS
3. Flexbox tools

In order to make a full landing page for a website.
